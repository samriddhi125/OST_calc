This is a Python-based Scientific Calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It supports basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced mathematical functions like square root, logarithm, and trigonometric functions.

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Advanced Functions**:
  - Square Root (`sqrt`)
  - Logarithm (`log`)
  - Trigonometric Functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`)
  - Power (`^`)
- **Additional Features**:
  - Clear (`C`)
  - Backspace (`⌫`)
  - Evaluates expressions dynamically
- **Stylized UI**:
  - Modern button layout with different colors for operations, numbers, and special functions
  - Responsive design using Tkinter grid

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.x).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
